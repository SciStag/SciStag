This project is still under heavy development and in a very early stage -
feel free to experiment with the modules and examples which are already
provided.

The goal of **SciStag** is to bundle the strengths of the many small, awesome
Python technologies from OpenCV via Flask to Pandas and enable users to combine
these libraries and build awesome data driven solutions with a minimum amount of
code.

SciStag currently consists of the following so called **stags**:

<table>
<tr><td><b>VisualLog</b></td>
<td>Allows the dynamic creation of documentation in HTML, Markdown and text format
and the fast data evaluation through its built-in in-place reload of Python
modules so you can quickly and efficiently dive into and browse through your 
data, evaluate different parameters quickly etc.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>ImageStag</b></td>
<td>Image analysis and modification made easy by combining the strengths of PILLOW, OpenCV and SKImage.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><b>MediaStag</b></td>
<td>Easy integration of streaming media data such as videos into your solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><b>DataStag</b></td>
<td>Low-latency inter-container and -process exchange of image and other binary data for Computer Vision and other data
  intensive microservice architectures.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>RemoteStag</b></td>
<td>Remote and asynchronous task execution - such as a neural network inference</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><b>WebStag</b></td>
<td>Helpful tools for accessing, processing web data and the easy provision
of Python components as local microservices.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>FileStag</b>
</td>
<td>
Tools for handling for large amount of files in a data engineering process 
such as easy scanning and handling data in an Azure Storage.
</td></tr>
</table>

## Setup

SciStag comes completely bundled with all required standard components.

`pip install scistag[full]` or when using poetry `poetry add scistag[full]` and
you are ready to go! :)

If you do not want to install advanced components such as Kivy you are also fine
with a more light-weighted

`pip install scistag[logstag,flask]`

## Getting started

You can already find several cool
demos [here](https://github.com/SciStag/SciStag/tree/main/scistag/examples) on
GitHub.

The most advanced and central component of SciStag is currently definitely **
VisualLog** which
lets you create log data and documentation very efficiently with a Jupyter-like
feeling but without loosing all the awesome code editing features of your
IDEs such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.

You can find the demos for **VisualLog** in the [
vislog](https://github.com/SciStag/SciStag/tree/main/scistag/examples/vislog)
examples folder.
