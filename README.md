This project is still under heavy development and in a very early stage - 
feel free to experiment with the modules and  examples which are already 
provided.

The goal of **SciStag** is to bundle the strengths of the many small, awesome 
Python technologies from OpenCV via Flask to Pandas and enable users to combine 
these libraries and build awesome data driven solutions with a minimum amount of
code.

SciStag currently consists of the following so called **stags**:

## VisLog - (short for VisualLogStag)

* Allows the dynamic creation of documentation in HTML, Markdown and text format
and the fast data evaluation through its built-in in-place reload of Python
modules.

## ImageStag

- Image analysis and modification made easy by combining the strengths of PILLOW, OpenCV and SKImage.

## MediaStag

- Easy integration of streaming media data such as videos into your solution.

## DataStag

- Low-latency inter-container and -process exchange of image and other binary data for Computer Vision and other data
  intensive microservice architectures.

## RemoteStag

- Remote and asynchronous task execution - such as a neural network inference

## WebStag

* Helpful tools for accessing, processing web data and the easy provision
of Python components as local microservices.

## FileStag

* Tools for handling for large amount of files in a data engineering process 
such as easy scanning and handling data in an Azure Storage.

---

## Setup

SciStag comes completely bundled with all required standard components.

`pip install scistag[full]` or when using poetry `poetry add scistag[full]` and you are ready to go! :)

### Optional components

* ImageStag (and other components using ImageStag) support the rendering of HTML and websites via
  [imgkit](https://pypi.org/project/imgkit/). If you do not use any of our pre-built Docker images please follow the
  instructions on https://pypi.org/project/imgkit/ for your operating system if you want to make use of HTML rendering.
