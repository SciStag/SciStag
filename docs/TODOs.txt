-- TODO NOTES --

- VisualLog: Move data source tracking to cell data to clear dependencies of each cell
  when ever the cell is fully rebuilt. Allow fix dependencies which can not be removed
  by a clear.
- VisualLog: Easy integration into MkDocs
- Bug: ImageStag: It's not possible to embed an SVG on disk as the filetype is not
  detected
- Bug: ImageStag: Image(None) raises NotImplementedError instead of warning that the
  data is None
- Bug: ImageStag: InterpolationMethod not exported
- Bug: ImageStag: Return Image from Image.resize method to be compatible to PIL
- "Bug": SciStag is currently incompatible with MkDocs due to outdated dependencies
  of MKDocs. To be verified if a compromise can be found.
- FileStag: Support for matching multiple extensions with file masks (e.g. FileSource)
- VisualLog: Move plotting functionality to separate class
- VisualLog: Finalization of dynamic markdown and basic mermaid integration
- VisualLog: Simplification of Cell visibility groups (e.g. removal of tabs)
- VisualLog: Passing column names to a VisualLog Table in it's constructor
- VisualLog: Stateless provision of web-sites to be able to host them via
  Lambda Functions / Azure Functions
- VisualLog: Image capturing, live and as stream and provision to a live server as
  stream or to lambda function or live server as single call.
- ImageStag: Easy blending two images
- MediaStag: Using a set of images or image file names as movie input source
- VisualLog: Using PIL and OpenCV images directly in VisualLog (w/o need of ImageStag)
- VisualLog: Easy customization of elements such as buttons
- VisualLog: More neutral and smaller button appearance
- VisualLog: Buttons should be able to auto-trigger with a defined frequency
- VisualLog: Modification of properties (such as a slider's index or the content of
  an image) without having to rewrite it's cell.
- VisualLog: Tests and example for the usage of attribute binding via .clref
- All: Removal of unnecessary requirements from the essentials file by recompiling it
- VisualLog: Add fetching print output in cell to options
- FileStag: Allow creating references to a file in a FileSource
- VisualLog: Parallel execution of embedded logs
- VisualLog: Lazy execution of streaming cells
- VisualLog: Finalization of snippet usage
- VisualLog: File dependencies and automatic cell rebuild on change
- VisualLog: Share cache between auto-reload sessions (again)
- All: Add unit tests for yet completely missing areas and remove them from the omit
  list
- VisualLog: Executing JavaScript commands
- VisualLog: Demos for DataStag
- VisualLog: Missing widgets:
    - Checkbox
    - ComboBox
    - Interactive image, e.g. pixel tracking
    - Progress bar
    - Pure int and float edit fields
    - ToggleButton
    - Color selection
    - Date picker
    - Emoji Widgets
    - MediaPlayer bar
    - Tag input
    - Defining ranges, range slider
    - Text field
- All: Evaluation of integration of mypy
- VisualLog: Effective logging and access for logs on virtual machines
- VisualLog: Providing access to the system's health status via the VisualLog server
- VisualLog: Add timestamps to log entries for a better overview
- VisualLog: Storing intermediate VisualLog reports in the cloud
- VisualLog: Possibility of passing a stream to Image constructor
- ImageStag: Rework of image filters
- FileStag save always overwrites, add check
- VisualLog: Asynchronicity. When starting VisualLog with autoreload no server is
  available while the log is being build. Also no progress is available when reloading.
- VisualLog: Catching VisualLog build assertions and storing them on a server if a
  process crashes.
- FileStag: Allow to cache FileSources from zip completely in memory
- FileStag: Cleaner Zip FileSink instead of ://
- FileStag: FilePath.get_size
- FileStag: Missing UnitTest for bundling and unbundling bytes
- FileStag: Bundling of images
- FileStag: Possibility to receive directory names from FileSource
- FileStag: Should .stscache always be created in the log dir, even if its temporary?
- All: Granting access to Material Design icons
- PlotStag: Fast histogram visualization via PlotStag
- VisualLog: VisualLog init start_browser does not fail even if the disk is neither
  hosted nor stored on disk
