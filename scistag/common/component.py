        They define which properties automatically call a setter function when 
        being changed, which properties are
        read-only, their type etc.
        
        To for example define a property ``x`` which shall automatically call 
        it's change handler ``set_x`` when being changed just declare it as 
        common member variable, add it to this variable as key and declare 
        the ``set_x`` method. When ever you want to change it's value directly 
        via ``myComponent.x = newValue`` the ``set_x`` function will be called. 
        To prevent recursion this function then has to store the value directly 
        to the object's dictionary via `self.__dict__['x'] = new_value`.
