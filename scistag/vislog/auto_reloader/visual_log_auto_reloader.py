"""
Implements the class :class:`VisualLogAutoReloader` which allows the live
editing of logs with the content changes being asap reflected in your IDE
and/or browser window.

It hosts a VisualLog as server at a defined IP as webservice and continuously
scans one or more source files for changes who create a log by themselves.
When ever any file was changed it lets these files build their log anew,
embeds its content and provides on a website.
